## Hi there, 
My name Hayden Beyer and I am student class of 2026 at St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY.

I am studying Statistics and Math-Envrionmental Science hoping to dive into sustainable agriculture or renewable energy!

I am currently working on gaining more statistical analysis wanting to make data driven descisions in my future fields.

Fun fact: I live on a family owned and operated dairy farm of about 250 total head!
